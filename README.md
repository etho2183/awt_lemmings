# Lemmings Game using WebXR

The project is a remake of the classig 1991 Lemmings game, developed through WebXR. It includes a simple HTML webpage, that leads the user to playig one of three levels in either VR or AR.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

This game can be played on the desktop, in VR and in AR. Depending on the desired mode, different hardware will be needed.
For the desktop version, a simple computer with screen and a mouse would suffice.
To play in VR, some kind of head mouted device is required. Additionally, access to a mouse will still be necessary for now, in order to play the game.
Playing the game in AR, the user would need to allow access to the camera and some markers, that the project will recognise.

### Installing

No installation is necessary, as the beauty of WebXR lies in being able to access the project through a simple web browser. However, there are some problems, when using Google Chrome, which do not exist in Mozilla Firefox.
